# Climate Impact on Agricultural Productivity

This project was created as the final project for the first class in the Northwestern Data Science with Python sequence. This study integrates four analytical approaches to assess how climate change influences crop yields and broader economic outcomes. First, these analytical questions allow for the study of how climate and agriculture vary over time and on a regional level. Across analyses, temperature patterns and extreme weather events consistently emerged as the primary drivers of agricultural performance. While global temperature trends showed no strong temporal patterns, regional analyses revealed substantial geographic variation, indicating that climate impacts are more meaningfully interpreted at the regional scale. Furthermore, the analysis questions worked to answer how well climate change variables correlated with crop yield and how they affect the economy. A key global finding shows that crop yields peak within an average temperature range of 10–20°C. Activity of Very High extreme weather event levels has also increased in recent years, and is most frequent in the United States, coinciding with relatively higher U.S. crop yields under severe conditions. Economic impact also showed a strong positive linear relationship with crop yield. These findings together highlight the need for region-specific climate policies and agricultural investments that enhance crop and soil resilience against climate change events, which can overall have an impact on economic welfare.
